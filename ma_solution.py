""" GOAL : Performs a research backwards, from the end of the pdf file, and look for '%%EOF' in bytes at the start of a line.
    To ensure %%EOF starts the line, the function block_find_eof() performs a rfind( b'\n%%EOF' ) on a block of
    bytes characters. The block then changes if not found, making the research progress backwards into the pdf.

    PARAMETERS : self.block_size = 30, it is the number of bytes contained in a block. Bigger blocks leads to faster computation

    RETURN : Nothing is returned, only the position in bytes of %%EOF is printed if found, else -1. """
